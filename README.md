#### ======================OVERVIEW=========================
This is an interactive application that allows librarians to be able to uniquley replace books online through fun and innovative ways that essentially remove the tedious aspects of replacing books in a library. This application encompasses a unique gamified way to sort books based on their respective call numbers. In a nutshell librarians will be able to drag and drop relevant call numbers and arrange them numerically then alphabetically. Once they are satisfied with their arrangement they can click the check button to see if they managed to obtain the correct order all whilst being under time contrainsts. This application creates healthy competion amongst the librarians and essentially takes away from the boring aspects of their job.

The motivation behind this application was to create something a six year old will enjoy. We as humans tend to fall into the trap of living a life of routine and constant work with not rewards. This application aims to solve that, it provides a ways to bring back the fun and interesting elements of being a librarian.
